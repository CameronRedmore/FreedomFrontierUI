# FreedomFrontierUI
A basic UI for the web services of The Freedom Frontier.
## What is this? ##
This repo simply contains basic CSS and HTML that can be used to emulate the styling of the FreedomFrontier's web navigation system.  
You're more than welcome to clone this repo and do pretty much whatever you want with it (as long as it's acceptable within the license that is).  
I don't really recommend using this UI design as it's not exactly... flashy, nor is the code the cleanest. In all honesty you're probably better off using pretty much anything BUT this layout design but who am I to tell you what to do with your website?  
Have fun!

### P.S ###
Anyone can view the source of a page and copy and paste it into their own website. It's not exactly hard now is it? <3
